# Human.AI_Test
Installation:
Clone this project:  https://github.com/Rahulraj0308/Human.AI_Test.git
#For Pip install
Install these dependencies (NumPy, OpenCV, Dlib):


"""pip install -r requirements.txt"""
The Dlib library has four primary prerequisites: Boost, Boost. Python, CMake, and X11/XQuartx. If you don't have them, you can read this article to know how to easily install them.

For Anaconda install


Run the demo: python main.py

Within the "model training" folder nestled in the human.ai directory lies the intricate process of crafting and refining our cutting-edge models. Here, data undergoes meticulous preprocessing, where it is cleaned, normalized, and transformed to reveal insights. Next,  designs and trains state-of-the-art models, leveraging advanced techniques in machine learning and deep learning. Through iterative experimentation and validation, these models are fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance. Finally, rigorous evaluation ensures the reliability and accuracy of our models before they are deployed for real-world applications.
